# Hashmaps

A _hashmap_ is a symbol table implementation which uses a hash function on a key to store key-value pairs in an ordered array.

## Assignment

For this assignment, please code _two_ separate hashmaps: `LinearProbingHM<K,V>` and `SeparateChainingHM<K,V>`.
In addition, please finish the `Student` class so that it is capable of being used as an index in the class
`Gradebook`.
